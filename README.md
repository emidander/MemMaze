# MemMaze

This repository contains the complete source code of MemMaze, a game for Android. From a technical point of view, the game features:

   * Non-OpenGL drawing, using a SurfaceView and Canvas
   * Handling touch events
   * Drawing with a constant frame rate

The code does not illustrate what you *must* do or even what you *should* do to make a game like this, but it does provide an example of how you *can* do it! 


## MemMaze on Google Play (Android Market) 

Although I have set the source code free, the game can still be downloaded [for free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.memmaze.free) or [not for free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.memmaze.free) from Google Play.
